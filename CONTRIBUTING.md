# Contributing to AskIso

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AskIso! This document outlines our development workflows, coding standards, and governance rules.

---

## Semantic Versioning Lifecycle Rule

All contributors and maintainers must strictly adhere to the project's semantic versioning lifecycle rule:

* **Initial Version**: The project starts at `v0.0.1`.
* **Increment Policy**: Every new release/iteration increments by `0.0.1` (e.g., `v0.0.1` → `v0.0.2` → `v0.0.3` ... → `v0.0.999` → `v0.1.0`).
* **Milestone Maturity**: To achieve `v0.1.0`, the product must have matured incrementally through `v0.0.999`.
* **Scope**: Mandatory standard across all project releases.

---

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites
* Go 1.26.6 or higher — the `go` directive in `go.mod` requires it, because that
  release carries the standard library security fixes AskIso builds against
* Make

### Building & Testing
```bash
# Build binary
make build

# Run full test suite with race detector
go test -v -race ./...

# Run the automated Ecosystem Quality Scorecard (Must score >= 0.90)
./scripts/ecosystem-scorecard.sh
```

---

## Code Quality Standards

1. **Formatting**: All Go files must be cleanly formatted using `gofmt -s -w .`.
2. **Static Analysis**: Code must pass `go vet ./...` with zero warnings.
3. **SPDX Headers**: Every Go and script file must begin with:
   ```go
   // SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Sebastien Rousseau <sebastian.rousseau@gmail.com>
   // SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 OR MIT
   ```
4. **Zero Unchecked Errors**: Always handle or explicitly ignore errors with `_ =`.
